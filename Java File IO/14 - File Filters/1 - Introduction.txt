File Filters:

    Filtering files in a directory using java.io.FileFilter and java.io.FilenameFilter.

File filters in Java provide a way to select specific files from a directory based on certain criteria. 
They are commonly used when you want to list or manipulate files in a directory but only want to work with 
files that meet specific conditions. Java provides two main interfaces for creating file filters: 
java.io.FileFilter and java.io.FilenameFilter.

When using file filters, keep in mind the following:

    The filter criteria logic should be implemented in the accept() method.
    You can implement complex filter conditions based on file properties like file size, last modified time, extension, etc.
    Use the listFiles() method with a FileFilter for an array of filtered files or the list() method with a FilenameFilter for an array of filtered filenames.
    Remember to handle exceptions and account for the possibility of null results if no files match the filter criteria.

Additionally, you can combine file filters with other operations, such as recursively traversing directories using methods like Files.walkFileTree() in the java.nio.file package or by implementing your own directory traversal logic.
