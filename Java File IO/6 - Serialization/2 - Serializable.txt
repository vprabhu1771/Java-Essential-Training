Implementing Serializable:

To enable serialization for a class, you need to implement the Serializable interface. This interface doesn't have any methods; it's a marker interface that indicates that the class can be serialized.

import java.io.Serializable;

public class Person implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor, methods, etc.
}
