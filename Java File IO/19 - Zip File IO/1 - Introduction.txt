Zip File I/O:
Reading and writing ZIP files using java.util.zip.ZipInputStream and java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.


File compression is the process of reducing the size of files by encoding the data in a more efficient way. 
In Java, you can work with file compression using various classes and libraries. Here are some ways to 
perform file compression in Java:


Apache Commons Compress:
The Apache Commons Compress library provides more advanced features for working with various compression formats, 
including ZIP, GZIP, TAR, and more. It offers additional flexibility and support for different compression algorithms.

Java NIO.2:
Starting from Java 7, the java.nio.file package provides facilities for creating ZIP files using 
the java.nio.file.FileSystem interface. This approach is more flexible and allows you to work with ZIP files as 
if they were directories.

Remember that when working with compression, you should be mindful of handling exceptions, closing resources properly, 
and checking for errors during compression and decompression operations.
