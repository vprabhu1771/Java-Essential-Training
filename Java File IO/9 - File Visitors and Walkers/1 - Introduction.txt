File Visitors and Walkers:
	Walking through directories using java.nio.file.FileVisitor and java.nio.file.FileVisitOption.
	Recursive file operations using java.nio.file.Files.walkFileTree().

File visitors and walkers are part of Java's NIO.2 (New I/O) package introduced in Java 7. 
They provide a powerful and flexible way to traverse and interact with file systems in a more structured manner 
compared to traditional file I/O. The NIO.2 package includes the java.nio.file package, which contains classes and 
interfaces for working with files and directories.
