    BufferedWriter wraps an existing Writer and adds buffering capabilities.
    When writing characters, it accumulates data in its buffer before actually writing it to the underlying stream, reducing the number of write operations.

import java.io.*;

public class BufferedWriterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("output.txt");
             BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(fileWriter)) {

            String text = "Hello, buffered world!";
            writer.write(text);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
