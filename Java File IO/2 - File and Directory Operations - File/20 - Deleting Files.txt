You can delete files using the delete() methods:

import java.io.File;

public class FileDeleteExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        File file = new File("path/to/file.txt");

        File newFile = new File("path/to/new_file.txt");

        boolean deleted = newFile.delete();

        System.out.println("Deleted: " + deleted);

    }
}
